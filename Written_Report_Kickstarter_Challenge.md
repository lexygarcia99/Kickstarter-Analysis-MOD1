# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The overview of the following project investigates an array of data given, and evaluates the ability to effectively manipulate data in a way to reach possiible solutions for a given 
concern. Throughout the project, a student should be able to show the necessary skills to construct additonal data columns and shape the data to more accurately represent the focus of
a certain issue. By relating the data to the the question and communicating what the client has a concern for, the student is successfully interpretting and displaying the foundation
of data-analysis.

### Purpose

This project was made to help Louise gather more information on fundraising goals in general because her play > came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
By reorganizing and focusing on different aspects of funding goals such as location, time of year, and amount pledged, we are able to see a more accurate trend of all the data given for the 
project to then speculate and deliver information that would assist Louise with her future endeavors.

## Analysis and Challenges

The sheet initially showed different campaigns from different countries, catagories of campaigns, timestamps of each, along with a few other parameters. I needed to
make sure each column had the correct type of data in each and then start deciphering the different random variables. The timestamps were changed to actual dates and created in new 
columns. The >catagory/subcatagory column
was copied then split into new columns to differientiate parent catagories from subcatagories to create an easier flow of information. While working through the data and creating 
charts for better visualizations, I saw that the Parent catagory of Louise's intrest in plays, which was Theater, had high counts of campaigns in mostly the US and Great Britain. 
In these countires, were also where the most successful play fundraising campaigns were.

The biggest challenge in beginning to help Lousie was combing through the initial data, and making sense of what was going on with all of the numbers and places.
While going through the data I quickly saw that there was alot of data to sort through, and needed to find the valuable data and separate from the less valuable data relating to Louise's 
request. Some data did not seem like it would be important, but later on helped to get a better understanding of things.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

After looking at the data it is clear that in general there are more successful outcomes than failed outcomes based on launch date (time of year). Moreover there is at least 20+ more 
successes that failures each month, excluding December. The highest success rates are in the spring and summer months, and the highest month being May with a total of 111 successful
outcomes, more than double the failures as well.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Generally speaking, the lower-priced goals have a higher percent chance of being successful than than the higher-priced goals. 75% of all the goals under $1000 end up being successful
(and is the most successful of goal ranges), but slowly declines and hit a 50% success rate aight in the $15,000-$19,999 before dipping even lower. The success rate only gets above 50%
again in the $35,000-$49,999 range and gets into higher failure rates for higher goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Throughout this project there were some difficulties that arised. I, personally, had issues while creating my grphs, specifically the Outcomes Based on Goals chart and getting the 
correct values for my chart. There were so many numbers to take percentages from and eventually found that the percentages were being taken from each of their own rows and not the totals
of everything itself. After figuring that out, the graph became alot easier to do after looking at the correct chart. I also had a little issue with this analysis and the format needed. 
I assumed that this world be a normal word document and didnt understand the formatting that was needed. After reading different documents over and over, I see that this will allow me 
to also be able to get through and traslate in the different softwares. I am still shakey but am learning as I go for future projects.


## Results

### Outcomes based on Launch Date

There is a correlation of successrate between the time of year and variable. It seems as though there is less activity for successful campaigns in the colder months versus the summer
months. During those hotter months, the success rate booms and that may be due to more people being out and about during the hot seasons, and possibly a reason for failures
in the cold months as there is less venturing out which could hinder the amount of pledges made and goals from becoming successful. 

There is also an increase in fundraising campaigns as time goes on. It seems as though fundraising campaigns are gaining popularity as years pass and may be a social phenomenon 
that is adding to the increase of popularity that may equate to more successful fundraising campaigns. 

### Outcomes based on Goals


Fundraising campaigns have a significantly higher chance of being successful when the campaign fund is on the lower side. The highest success rate is 75.8% for goals under $1,000, and
72.7% for goals that are between $1,000 to $4,999. These 2 catagories make up the majority of all successful outcomes. Although the success rate goes above 50% again in the 
$35,000 to $49,999, the number of successes is signnificantly lower than the lower goals.

### Limitations and Recommendations

This dataset, although accounting for most variables, lacks different population sizes and age ranges for the audience that each campaigns could possibly be geared towards. There may be 
further data supporting the age ranges of backers and successful outcomes as well as the opposite. Population of certain geographical locations may also change the dataset and rate of 
success within different areas with different priorities and outcomes. Places with a higher population size have more of an ability for find backers and more of an opportunity to physically
ask for pledges. One last limitation that may be a bit more far-fetched could be the difference in requirments that each could have for public fundrasing opportunities based on type of
government.

Some of the graphs listed below could also be created to help assist the dataset:

- A central tendency diagram to further show the time of year influence on variables
- A line chart showing amount of time funraising campaign given and rate of success/failure
- A central tendecy chart showing the skewness of the data from the Outcomes based on Goals data
